# Getting Started

Welcome to the IQToolkit ecosystem! This guide will help you understand how to discover and use the various tools available in the IQToolkit collection.

## What is IQToolkit?

IQToolkit is not a single package, but rather an ecosystem of specialized tools designed for data analysis, database optimization, and intelligent automation. Each tool is developed independently and can be used standalone or in combination with other tools.

## Prerequisites

Most IQToolkit tools require:

- **Python 3.11+** (Python 3.12+ recommended)
- **pip** for package management
- **Git** for accessing source code (optional)

Each tool has its own comprehensive documentation with:
- Installation instructions

1. **Check requirements** in the tool's documentation
2. **Install the tool** using pip or your preferred method
3. **Configure** as needed for your environment
4. **Start using** the tool with examples and guides

## Example: Getting Started with a Tool
